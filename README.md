A supermarket owner wants to automate the billing process. Currently, they calculate each item’s cost manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. They want a program that calculates the total bill quickly and applies discounts automatically.
Requirements:
1.	The program should ask the cashier how many different items the customer bought.
2.	For each item, the cashier will input:
o	Item name
o	Price per unit
o	Quantity purchased
3.	The program should use a for loop to process all items.
4.	For each item, calculate subtotal = price × quantity and add it to the total bill.
5.	If the total bill is greater than 50,000, apply a 5% discount.
6.	Print a receipt showing:
o	Item name, quantity, price per unit, and subtotal
o	Grand total before discount
o	Discount (if any)
o	Final amount payable
Learning Focus:
•	Variables, arrays, arithmetic operators
•	For loop for repeated input
•	Conditional statements for discounts

Case Study 2: Student Grading System (While Loop)
Background:
A university lecturer wants a program to help record student exam marks. The lecturer does not 
know in advance how many students will take the exam, so the system should allow continuous 
entry until they decide to stop.
Requirements:
1. The program should repeatedly ask the lecturer to enter a student’s marks (0–100).
2. Use a while loop to keep collecting marks until the lecturer enters -1 (sentinel value).
3. For each student:
   o Assign a grade using if–else:
▪ A = 80–100
▪ B = 70–79
▪ C = 60–69
▪ D = 50–59
▪ F = below 50
o Print the student’s grade immediately.
4. Keep track of:
o Total number of students entered
o Number of passes (marks ≥ 50)
o Number of fails (marks < 50)
5. When data entry ends, print a summary report showing:
o Total students
o Passed vs failed count
o Class pass rate in percentage
Learning Focus:
• While loop for unknown number of iterations
• If–else decision-making
• Counters and percentages
Case Study 3: Class Attendance Tracker (Do-While Loop & Arrays)
Background:
A class representative (CR) wants to keep daily attendance for a class of fixed size. Attendance 
is recorded each day until the CR decides to stop. At the end of the semester, the CR wants a 
summary to see how attendance varied.
Requirements:
1. Ask the CR to enter the total number of students in the class.
2. Use a do-while loop to record attendance for each day.
o Input number of students present.
o Store this in an array (max 30 days).
o Ask if they want to enter attendance for another day (yes/no).
3. After data entry is complete:
o Calculate the average attendance.
o Identify all days where attendance was below 50% of total class size.
o Print the attendance list in a table format (Day X → Number present).
o Print the average and percentage of days with low attendance.
Learning Focus:
• Do-while loop ensures attendance is recorded at least once.
• Arrays for storing daily records.
• Conditional logic for analyzing attendance data.

Case Study 1: Rectangle Area Calculator
Scenario:
A school wants a simple program to calculate the area of a rectangle by entering its length and 
width. Students should also be able to check if the rectangle is a square.
Concepts used:
• Variables (length, width)
• if condition (check square or not)
• Class with method (calculate area)
Question:
Write a Java program with a class Rectangle that has two variables: length and width.
• Create a method calculateArea() that returns the area.
• In the main method, ask the user to enter length and width.
• Print the area.
• Use an if condition to check if the rectangle is a square.


Case Study 2: Circle Area with Switch Menu
Scenario:
A mathematics teacher wants a program where students can choose between finding the area or 
the circumference of a circle.
Concepts used:
• Class Circle with radius variable
• Switch case for menu selection
• Method for area() and circumference()
Question:
Write a Java program with a class Circle that has one variable: radius.
• Create methods calculateArea() and calculateCircumference().
• In main(), ask the user to enter the radius.
• Use a switch case:
o Case 1: Print the area
o Case 2: Print the circumference
